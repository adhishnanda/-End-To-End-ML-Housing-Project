# California Housing Project End-t0-End Implementation
Welcome to the Machine Learning Housing Corporation! Your first task is to
use California census data to build a model of housing prices in the state. This
data includes metrics such as the population, median income, and median
housing price for each block group in California. Block groups are the smallest
geographical unit for which the US Census Bureau publishes sample data (a
block group typically has a population of 600 to 3,000 people). We will call
them “districts” for short.
Your model should learn from this data and be able to predict the median
housing price in any district, given all the other metrics.

# About Dataset
We’ll use the California Housing Prices dataset from the StatLib
repository. This dataset is based on data from the 1990
California census. It is not exactly recent (a nice house in the Bay Area was still
affordable at the time), but it has many qualities for learning, so we will pretend
it is recent data. For some purposes categorical attribute has been added and
few features have been removed.
